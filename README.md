# MyUtils
A simple code-reuse setup for windows
Lots of people getting started in their programming journeys don't reuse their code enough. While this only demonstrates code reuse for Python as of now, my goal is to expand it to other languages like Java, C++, etc so that newbies can reuse code from the get-go.
Simply fork this reposity, populate it with your code, run the setup.bat script, and reuse away!
