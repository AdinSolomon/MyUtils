# MyUtils
### A simple but aspirationally-universal code-reuse setup for windows

Many of my projects accumulate utils functions over time, and in many cases I will copy/paste utils functions from my other projects. My goal is to unify all of my projects' utils functions into a single package so I can reuse my code as much as possible. 

Lots of people getting started in their programming journeys don't reuse their code enough. While this only demonstrates code reuse for Python as of now, my goal is to expand it to other languages like Java, C++, etc so that newbies can reuse code from the get-go.

Simply fork this reposity, populate it with your code, run the setup.bat script, and reuse away! Since you've forked the repo, you can easily reuse your code across machines, too.
